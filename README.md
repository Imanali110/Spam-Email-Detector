ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
ðŸ”¹ Models Used: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Preprocessing and Text Cleaning â€“ Removed special characters, converted text to lowercase, and applied stemming using NLTKâ€™s PorterStemmer.
âœ… Feature Extraction using CountVectorizer â€“ Converted email text into numerical format, creating a bag-of-words model with up to 4000 features.
âœ… Model Training and Evaluation â€“ Trained multiple machine learning models and compared their performance using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and classification reports.
âœ… Spam Detection Function â€“ Developed a real-time email classification function that predicts whether an email is spam or ham using the trained NaÃ¯ve Bayes model
